React + Vite
This project uses Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

Two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel (or oxc in rolldown-vite) for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

React Compiler
The React compiler is not enabled in this template due to its impact on dev & build performance.
If you'd like to enable it, follow the official guide:

👉 https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation

ESLint Configuration
For production-grade applications, TypeScript with type-aware lint rules is recommended.
Check out the TS template here:
